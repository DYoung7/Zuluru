<p>Schedules are typically created unpublished, to allow the coordinator a chance to make any required adjustments (e.g. if a particular team needs to play on a specific field or at a specific time, or if there is a team matchup that needs to be guaranteed) before people see them and start making plans.</p>
<p>A day's games can be published during the edit process by checking the "Set as published" box. Alternately, if the schedule is correct as-is, it can be published with the "Publish" link on the league schedule. Days that have at least one game that has not yet been finalized can also be hidden with the Unpublish link.</p>
