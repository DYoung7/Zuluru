<p>The "My Teams" section of the Zuluru home page provides a list of the teams you are on, limited to leagues that are either ongoing, closed recently, or will open soon.</p>
<p>Clicking the team name will take you to the team details and roster page.</p>
<p>To change your position on the team, including removing yourself from the roster, click on the position currently listed in parentheses after the team name. Note that you can typically only demote yourself through this method; promoting players to greater levels of responsibility must be done by the captain.</p>
<p>If you are a captain of the team, and the roster deadline has not yet passed, there will be an "Add Player" link here that will allow you to add players through a variety of means.</p>
