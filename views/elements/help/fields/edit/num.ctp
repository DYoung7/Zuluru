<p>When there are multiple fields at a single facility, the individual fields are distinguished by "number". This might be as simple as "1", "2" and "3", it might be "East" and "West", or (particularly at large multi-use facilities) it might be something more like "Soccer 1 North".</p>
<p>As this is used in a number of displays, it should be kept as succinct as possible, without loss of specificity. For example, "Soccer1N" might be sufficient instead of "Soccer 1 North". One common scheme is to number fields starting with the field closest to the parking lot or entrance. Remember that players can always refer to the field layout diagram if they are in doubt.</p>
